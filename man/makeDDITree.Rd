\title{Build a simplified DDI Codebook tree}
\usage{
makeDDITree(root = "codeBook")
}
\arguments{
\item{root}{Character, the root element to start from (default \code{"codeBook"}).}
}
\value{
A nested (tree) list of labels in the form "\if{html}{\out{<element>}}: \if{html}{\out{<title>}}",
plus a list of all elements.
}
\description{
Builds a tree-shaped representation of the DDI Codebook 2.6 element
hierarchy using only element names and their title descriptions.
The result is a nested list where each node is labeled as
"\if{html}{\out{<element>}}: \if{html}{\out{<title>}}". Leaf nodes are returned as empty lists so every
level consistently contains lists.
}
\examples{

# Build the simplified tree as an R list
tree <- makeDDITree()
