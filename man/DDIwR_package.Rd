\title{Useful functions for various DDI (Data Documentation Initiative)
related outputs.}
\description{
This package provides various functions to read DDI based
metadata documentation and write dedicated setup files for R, SPSS, Stata and
SAS to read an associated .csv file containing the raw data, apply labels for
variables and values and also deal with the treatment of missing values.

It can also generate a DDI metadata file out of an R information object,
which can be used to export directly to the standard statistical packages
files (such as SPSS, Stata and SAS, or even Excel), using the versatile
package \bold{\pkg{haven}}. For R, the default object to store data and
metadata is a \bold{\code{data.frame}}, and labelled data are automatically
coerced to class \code{declared}.

The research leading to the initial functions in this package has received
funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013)
under grant agreement no. 262608 (DwB - Data without Boundaries)
