\description{
This function converts (or transfers) between R, Stata, SPSS, SAS, Excel and
DDI XML files. Unlike the regular import / export functions from packages
\bold{\pkg{haven}} or \bold{\pkg{rio}}, this function uses the DDI standard
as an exchange platform and facilitates a consistent conversion of the
missing values.
}
\details{
When the argument \strong{\code{to}} specifies a certain statistical package
(\code{"R"}, \code{"Stata"}, \code{"SPSS"}, \code{"SAS"}, \code{"XPT"}) or \code{"Excel"}, the name of the
destination file will be identical to the one in the argument \strong{\code{from}},
with an automatically added software specific extension.

SPSS portable file (with the extension \code{".por"}) can only be read, but not
written.

The argument \strong{\code{to}} can also be specified as a path to a specific file,
in which case the software package is determined from its file extension.
The following extentions are currently recognized: \code{.xml} for DDI,
\code{.rds} for R, \code{.dta} for Stata, \code{.sav} for SPSS, \code{.xpt} for SAS, and
\code{.xlsx} for Excel.

Additional parameters can be specified via the three dots argument
\strong{\code{...}}, that are passed to the respective functions from packages
\bold{\pkg{haven}} and \bold{\pkg{readxl}}. For instance the function
\bold{\code{\link[haven]{write_dta}()}} has an additional argument called
\strong{\code{version}} when writing a Stata file.

The most important argument to consider is called \strong{\code{user_na}}, part of
the function \bold{\code{\link[haven]{read_sav}()}}. Defaulted to \code{FALSE} in
package \bold{\pkg{haven}}, in package \bold{\pkg{DDIwR}} it is used as
having the value of \code{TRUE}, and it can be deactivated by explicitly
specifying \code{user_na = FALSE} in function \strong{\code{convert()}}.

The same three dots argument is used to pass additional parameters to other
functions in this package, for instance \strong{\code{exportCodebook()}} when writing
to a DDI file. One of its argument \strong{\code{embed}} (activated by default) can be
used to control embedding the data in the XML file. Deactivating it will
create a CSV file in the same directory, using the same file name as the
XML file.

When converting from DDI, if the dataset is not embedded in the XML file, the
CSV file is expected to be found in the same directory as the DDI Codebook,
and it should have the same file name as the XML file. The path to the CSV
file can be provided via the \strong{\code{csv}} argument. Additional formal
parameters of the function \bold{\code{\link[utils]{read.csv}()}} can
be passed via the same three dots \strong{\code{...}} argument. Alternatively, the
\strong{\code{csv}} argument can also be an R data frame.

When converting to DDI, if the argument \strong{\code{embed}} is set to \code{FALSE}, users
have the option to save the data in a separate CSV file (the default) or not
to save the data at all, by setting \strong{\code{csv}} to \code{FALSE}.

The DDI .xml file generates unique IDs for all variables, if not already
present in the attributes. These IDs are useful for referencing purposes, in
newer versions of the DDI Codebook.

The argument \strong{\code{chartonum}} signals recoding character categorical
variables, and employs the function \bold{\code{\link{recodeCharcat}()}}.
This only makes sense when recoding to Stata, which does not allow allocating
labels for anything but integer variables.

If the argument \strong{\code{to}} is left to \code{NULL}, the data is (invisibly) returned
to the R enviroment. Conversion to R, either in the working space or as
a data file, will result (by default) in a data frame containing declared
labelled variables, as defined in package \bold{\pkg{declared}}.

The current version reads and creates DDI Codebook version 2.6, with future
versions to extend the functionality for DDI Lifecycle versions 3.x and link
to the future package \bold{DDI4R} for the UML model based version 4. It
extends the standard DDI Codebook by offering the possibility to embed a
serialized version of the R dataset into the XML file containing the
Codebook, within a \code{notes} child of the \code{fileDscr} component. This type of
generated codebook is unique to this package and automatically detected when
converting to another statistical software. This will likely be replaced with
a time insensitive text version.

Converting to SAS is experimental, and it relies on the same package
\bold{\pkg{haven}} that uses the ReadStat C library. The safest way to
convert, which at the same time consistently converts the missing values, is
to export the data to a CSV file and create a setup file produced by function
\bold{\code{\link{setupfile}()}} and run the commands manually.

Converting data from SAS is possible, however reading the metadata is also
experimental (the current version of \bold{haven} only partially imports the
metadata). Either specify the path to the catalog file using the argument
\strong{\code{catalog_file}} from the function \bold{\code{\link[haven]{read_sas}()}},
or have the catalog file in the same directory as the data set, with the same
file name and the extension \code{.sas7bcat}

The argument \strong{\code{recode}} controls how missing values are treated. If the
input file has SPSS like numeric codes, they will be recoded to extended
(a-z) missing types when converting to Stata or SAS. If the input has Stata
like extended codes, they will be recoded to SPSS like numeric codes.

The character \strong{\code{encoding}} is usually passed to the corresponding functions
from package \bold{\pkg{haven}}. It can be set to \code{NULL} to reset at the
default in that package.

Converting to SPSS works with numerical and character labelled vectors, with
or without labels. Date/Time variables are partially supported by package
\strong{haven}: either having such a variable with no labels and missing values,
or if labels and missing values are declared the variable is automatically
coerced to numeric, and users may have to make the proper settings in SPSS.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming an SPSS file called test.sav is located in the working directory
# The following command imports the file into the R environment:
test <- convert("test.sav")

# The following command will extract the metadata in a DDI Codebook and
# produce a test.xml file in the same directory
convert("test.sav", to = "DDI")

# The data may be saved separately from the DDI file, using:
convert("test.sav", to = "DDI", embed = FALSE)

# To produce a Stata file:
convert("test.sav", to = "Stata")

# To produce an R file:
convert("test.sav", to = "R")

# To produce an Excel file:
convert("test.sav", to = "Excel")
